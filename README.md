# Object-Detection

This project demonstrates the implementation of an object detection system using Python, leveraging powerful libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and YOLO. The primary goal is to detect and localize objects within images and video streams in real-time.

**Features**
***Real-time Object Detection*** : Capable of detecting multiple objects in real-time using YOLO.
***Model Training and Evaluation*** : Includes scripts for training and evaluating custom object detection models.
***Pre-trained Models*** : Utilizes pre-trained models for quick deployment and testing.
***Video and Image Processing*** : Supports both video streams and static images for object detection.
***Visualization*** : Annotates detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels for better visualization.
